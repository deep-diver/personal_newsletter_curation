# Curated Personal Newsletter

## Motivation
Today people use social networking platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. to understand whatâ€™s happening in the field of their interest. They do this by following influencers' accounts or hitting a share/retweet button. It is good for them to keep all the interesting information on their walls.

However, the problem arises when they click the share/retweet button too many times. They will end up with a pile of information all around, and they might not even remember what each piece of information is about.

## How this project can help?
The end product of this project collects all the posts from one's SNS wall (including personal note/shared/retweeted), then it will send a automatically curated periodic newsletter. 

The curation is a simple process. It will go through each post and classify them by their topics. In this way, all the massy pile of information coulde be organized in a meaningful way to be consumed more easily.

## Architecture
This project is designed to show how to build End-to-End Machine Learning pipeline on Google Cloud Platform.
