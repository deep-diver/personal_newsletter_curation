# Curated Personal Newsletter

## Motivation
Today people use social networking platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. to understand whatâ€™s happening in the field of their interest. They do this by following influencers' accounts or hitting a share/retweet button. It is good for them to keep all the interesting information on their walls.

However, the problem arises when they click the share/retweet button too many times. They will end up with a pile of information all around, and they might not even remember what each piece of information is about.

## How this project can help?
The end product of this project collects all the posts from one's SNS wall (including personal note/shared/retweeted), then it will send a automatically curated periodic newsletter. 

The curation is a simple process. It will go through each post and classify them by their topics. In this way, all the massy pile of information coulde be organized in a meaningful way to be consumed more easily.

## Architecture
This project is designed to show how to build End-to-End Machine Learning pipeline on Google Cloud Platform.

Below shows the products consisting of the whole pipeline and their roles in this project.
- **Cloud Scheduler**
  - There are two periodic works. One for collecting new data for updating the deployed/trained latest model. The other one is for publishing a newsletter. It collects data from SNS and push the data to go through the data validation/transformation pipeline. When the data is ready, it will be fed into the existing model to get predictions. Based on the returned prediction, newsletter will be constructed and published.
- **BigQuery**
  - This is mainly for storing historical data that has been collected periodically.
- **Dataflow**
  - Dataflow is used for Data Extraction/Validation, Data Transformation, and Model Evaluation purposes. 
- **Cloud Storage**
  - There are a bunch of intermediate results from Data Extraction/Validation, Data Transformation, Model Training, and Model Analysis. Those intermediate results are stored in Cloud Storage service.
- **AI Platform**
  - AI Platform is used for training and serving a model. The newly trained model is stored in Cloud Storage service.

## Todo
- [ ] Collect & Label text data from Twitter / Facebook
- [ ] Train & Evaludate an intial model 
- [ ] Build a pipeline shown in the Archtecture
- [ ] Testing
